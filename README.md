# Known Breaches
A compliation of breach information gathered from data aggregators and breach lookup services. This also ships with a basic HTML/JS client-side search for the datasets, this can be hosted on any webserver or ran locally, alternatively you can search the data online [here](https://breaches.dls.sh/).

**Currently supports:**
 - HaveIBeenPwned.com
 - Dehashed.com
 - Leak-Lookup.com
 - Vigilante.pw

You can find the datasets in `datasets/`, each file here contains data obtained from the individual providers with the exception of `combined.json` which is a compilation of all four.

As vigilante.pw is currently down and has been for a while, the data set from the following github repository was used [https://github.com/wedataintelligence/Vigilante.pw](https://github.com/wedataintelligence/Vigilante.pw).

If you have any suggestions feel free to create an issue or submit a PR :)
